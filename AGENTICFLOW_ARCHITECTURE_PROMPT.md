# AgenticFlow: Universal Agentic Automation System - Complete Architecture Prompt

## Project Vision & Core Concept

Create a next-generation visual workflow automation platform that serves as the "WordPress of automation" - where anyone can create, share, and monetize custom automation nodes through a sophisticated plugin ecosystem. Think Zapier meets n8n meets VSCode extensions, but built from the ground up for AI-first workflows and maximum extensibility.

## System Overview

### Core Philosophy
- **Plugin-First Architecture**: Every node is a plugin, even built-in ones
- **Zero-Lock-in**: Users own their workflows and can export/import everything
- **AI-Native**: Designed for LLM integration, dynamic data extraction, and intelligent automation
- **Developer-Friendly**: Rich APIs, TypeScript-first, comprehensive tooling
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Security, scalability, monitoring, and compliance built-in
- **Community-Driven**: Open marketplace for node plugins with monetization

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Business Process Automation**: Complex multi-step workflows with conditional logic
2. **AI Agent Orchestration**: Chain multiple AI models and tools together
3. **Data Pipeline Creation**: ETL processes with real-time monitoring
4. **API Integration Hub**: Connect disparate services with custom logic
5. **Content Generation Workflows**: Automated content creation and distribution
6. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Complex event-driven notification systems
