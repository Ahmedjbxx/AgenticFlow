Migration Strategy (Gradual, Non-Breaking)
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
Set up new directory structure
Create base interfaces and abstractions
Implement NodeRegistry and EventBus
Add configuration management
Phase 2: Node System (Week 3-4)
Convert existing nodes to plugin system one by one
Keep old system running in parallel
Migrate HTTP Request node first (already modular)
Phase 3: State Management (Week 5)
Implement Zustand store
Gradually migrate useState to centralized state
Add persistence layer
Phase 4: Polish (Week 6)
Add error boundaries
Implement proper logging
Add testing infrastructure
Performance optimizations
🎯 Benefits of This Architecture:
🔌 Extensibility: New nodes are self-contained plugins
🧪 Testability: Each component can be tested in isolation
📦 Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
⚡ Performance: Lazy loading of node plugins
🔒 Security: Sandboxed execution context per node
🏗️ Scalability: Can handle hundreds of node types

👥 Team-Friendly: Multiple developers can work on different n
